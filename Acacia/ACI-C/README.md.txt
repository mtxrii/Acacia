# Acacia bytecode interpreter

Eventually, a bytecode compiler will be made for Acacia. This will be written in C.

But first, the groundwork needs to be laid and all specifications of the language still need to be created (and implemented).

When the first version of Acacia is released, implementation of a C compiler will probably begin.
