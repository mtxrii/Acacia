# Acacia ðŸŒ±
Acacia strives to be a clean, elegant and modern OOP language with elements of functional programming.

Largely based off of Bob Nystrom's [Lox](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters), it is interpreted top down using a tree-walker written in Java. Most of the syntax and elegant scoping rules are parallel to that of Lox's, however it also shines in it's support for modern convenience utilities and features of the realm of python and ruby. An infinite thanks to Nystrom's [book](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) though, which guided me through laying the foundations for this project.

Programming in Acacia should instantly feel familiar, with a syntax much like javascript's.
```javascript
let x = 16;

while (x > 0) {
    //Print numbers divisible by 4.
    if (x % 4 == 0) println(x);
    x--;
}
```

Variables are dynamically typed and garbage collected. Loops and blocks use brackets. Statements end in semicolons. Comments start with double backslashes. All of that.

But...
### There's only 3 primitive types.
Strings, Numbers and Booleans. 

No need for chars. Or ints. Any single character string is still a string, and any number with no decimal is still a double (even if it ends with .0). Any internal conversions are automatically taken care of, and casting errors are no more.

### Built in lists.
Or sets should I say? Thats what they're called in Acacia, but same thing. Much like in python, no instantiations are necesary. let `set = [1,2,3]` and you're *set*. Sets also come with a whole *set* of built in methods that harness their inner array-ness. Use them as a stack, or queue, or tuple.

### Closured functions, classes and variables.
Blocks can be declared anywhere, not just in functions, classes and loops. At any point, a complete separation from the current environment is possible. Define a variable outside a scope, create the most complex of complex algorithms inside, assign the result to the variable, and voila. All is stored under the hood. This is how most object boxes are defined, by the way. They create an environment to define the object, then assign it to a variable in the global scope. Speaking of which...

### Box has been opened.
Boxes, or packages, can represent anything from a full fledged extension to another one of your scripts you just need to import. Much like JavaScript, your starting script is the entry point, which then calls other boxes to be opened (with the `open` keyword in fact) allowing extendable scripts the freedom to run their own code, modify your's, implement a data structure or two, or completely emerse you in a new coding environment.

# Test it out
Once compiled (or downloaded), to fire it up in REPL mode simply run Acacia.
```
.\acacia
```

Or specify a `.aci` file (preferably with path) to run
```
.\acacia testScript.aci
```

## Write some programs
Acacia is a scripting language, meaning files are read and statements are evaluated top to bottom. No need for a main() method or other entry point. Just start scripting away. Any plaintext file can be read, but convention specifies that it should have the `.aci` extension. (but really do whatever you want, no one's stopping you).
Learn more about language specifics in the [docs](DOCS.md).
